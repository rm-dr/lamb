# Lamb: A Lambda Calculus Engine


## Todo (pre-release):
 - Good command parsing (`:save`, `:load`, are a bare minimum)
 - $\alpha$-equivalence check
 - Prettyprint functions (combine args, rename bound variables)
 - Write a nice README
 - Delete macros
 - Handle or avoid recursion errors

## Todo:
 - live syntax check
 - Command and macro autocomplete
 - step-by-step reduction
 - Maybe a better icon?
 - Warn when overwriting macro
 - Syntax highlighting: parenthesis, bound variables, macros, etc
 - Pin header to top of screen
 - Parser is a bit slow. Maybe we can do better?
 - pypi package

## Mention in Docs
 - lambda functions only work with single-letter arguments
 - church numerals
 - how to install
